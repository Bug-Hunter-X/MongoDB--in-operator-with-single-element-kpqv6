# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Element
This repository demonstrates a common misconception when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries.  While seemingly innocuous, using `$in` with a single element is inefficient and can lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets.

## Problem
The `$in` operator is designed to check if a field matches any value within an array.  However, using it with a single-element array is unnecessary and less efficient than using a simple equality check.

## Solution
Replace the `$in` operator with a direct equality comparison for better performance and clarity.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the provided scripts to see the inefficient query (bug.js) and the corrected query (bugSolution.js) in action.
